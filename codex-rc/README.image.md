# sbx/codex-image

Base image for the Codex agent kit for
[Docker Sandboxes](https://docs.docker.com/ai/sandboxes/).

## Contents

Built on `docker/sandbox-templates:shell-docker`: the standard sandbox tool
chain plus a Docker engine, requesting Docker-in-Docker via
`com.docker.sandboxes.start-docker=true`. On top of that:

- `@openai/codex`, OpenAI's Codex CLI, installed via its standalone installer
  (a prebuilt native binary, not the npm package)
- `xdg-utils`, so the `xdg-open` that the kit's `BROWSER` variable names exists
  (installed without its recommends, which are the X11 half of the package)

Runs as the non-root `agent` user, with `CMD ["codex"]`.
